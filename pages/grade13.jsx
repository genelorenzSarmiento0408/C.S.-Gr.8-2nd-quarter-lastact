                I was scared when I was entering grade 1. I thought Tr. Homer
                (+) and Ma'am Lea were super strict, and when I was noisy I
                thought I would be kicked out in the class. I was included in
                the honor roll in my section. Then in Grade 3, When I was noisy,
                we were kicked out in the classroom
              </p>
              <h2>Grade 2</h2>
              <p style={{ marginLeft: "3rem" }}>
                Then in Grade 2, nothing has changed. Still in the honor roll
              </p>
              <h2>Grade 3</h2>
              <p style={{ marginLeft: "3rem" }}>
                Then in Grade 3, When I was noisy, we were kicked out in the
                classroom
